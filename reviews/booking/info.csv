Our stay at this hotel was really above and beyond.. to begin with1. staff was amazing spl.. divya @ reception2. Room was impeccable which was miles beyond expectation with top class interior3. Kids enjoyed games underone roof like table tennis, badminton,football, carrom, dart game4. The pool was amazingly clean with floaters and under the observation of one staff member for cleanliness and safety5. Restaurant is just besides the pool and the food preparation is hygenic and food tastes yummy6. Just because its a perfect place for adults as well as kids i planned to extend my stay for another 2 days ... kudos to whole staff for making up our vacation❤️"
