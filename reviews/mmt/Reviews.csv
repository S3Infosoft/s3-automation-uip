"Shyamsunder Karekar, Jan 04, 2019",Great location on a hilltop,"Although since it is a new one, it lacks some greenery. Rooms are really big. However bathrooms lacked ventilation as there was no exhaust. Kitchen is not able to handle a rush of guests. Took a long time to prepare. Other amenities like swimming pool, courts are real advantage to this property. Mobile signal was weak. Hotel name been changed to ocean valley so finding this resort was not easy. Access roads are really narrow.",5.0
